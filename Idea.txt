Idea: Find the best taco place near you
Input: Zip Code, City, State, Radius, Budget
Output: List of n number of best taco places in your radius and budget

Algorithm:
    * Find reviews on each taco place
        * rate reviews based on stars given and number of reviews
    * With the radius inputted, and the budget, find the restaurants that are
        * closest to you
        * in budget range
        * best reviews

    example: y = 0.3 * (mileage) + 0.5 * (reviews) + 0.2 * (price)

find nearest restaurant(city, state, zipcode, lat, long)
    pandas parses for zipcode first then finds distances with lat long

get yelp reviews(restaurant):
    with restaurant name as input, get yelp reviews, ratings, number of reviews, and sentiment analysis

rate the restaurant(distance, ratings, budget?):
    use our own algorithm to rate the restaurants based on our criteria
    # $ <= 10
    # $$ >=11 , $$ <= 30
    # $$$ >=31, $$$ <=60
    # $$$$ >61


Extra Idea: Create personalized reccomendations based on what you chose
Algorithms:
    Look for trends and similar information based on the restaurants you picked
        ex: if you pick cheap restaurants, the program will look for cheap restaurants to reccomend to you
    Once you pick a restaurant, it saves it into its own file
